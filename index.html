      How the Nixon-Kennedy Debate Changed the World

          It's now common knowledge that without the nation's first televised
          debate — fifty years ago Sunday — Kennedy would never have been
          president. But beyond securing his presidential career, the 60-minute
          duel between the handsome Irish-American senator and Vice President
          Richard Nixon fundamentally altered political campaigns, television
          media and America's political history. "It's one of those unusual
          points on the timeline of history where you can say things changed
          very dramatically — in this case, in a single night," says Alan
          Schroeder, a media historian and associate professor at Northeastern
          University, who authored the book, Presidential Debates: Forty Years
          of High-Risk TV

          Kennedy's aide and speech writer, Ted Sorensen remembers prepping the
          candidate for the big night. They were on the roof of their Chicago
          hotel, running through a pile of note cards, quizzing Kennedy on the
          likely debate topics while he worked on his tan. "We knew the first
          televised debate was important, but we had no idea how important it
          was going to turn out," Sorensen told TIME. After hours of practice
          and a speech before a labor union, the senator went in to take a nap.
          "The story I like to tell is of when they delegated me to go wake him
          up," Sorensen said. "I opened the door and peaked in and there he was,
          lights on, sound asleep, covered in notecards."

          What happened after the two candidates took the stage is a familiar
          tale. Nixon, pale and underweight from a recent hospitalization,
          appeared sickly and sweaty, while Kennedy appeared calm and confident.
          As the story goes, those who listened to the debate on the radio
          thought Nixon had won. But those listeners were in the minority. By
          1960, 88% of American households had televisions — up from just 11%
          the decade before. The number of viewers who tuned in to the debate
          has been estimated as high as 74 million, by the Nielsen of the day,
          Broadcast Magazine. Those that watched the debate on TV thought
          Kennedy was the clear winner. Many say Kennedy won the election that
          night. Sorensen says the Kennedy team didn't realize what a game
          changer the debate was until the following day at a campaign event in
          Ohio. "The crowds for his motorcade were much larger than they'd ever
          been," he says. "That's when we knew that, if nothing else, Kennedy
          had firmed up support for himself in the Democratic party."
        </p>
        <p>
          Nixon performed much better in the subsequent debates (and appeared
          better thanks to the "milkshake diet" his aides put him on to fatten
          him up). But, as Schroeder says, the damage had been done. "You
          couldn't wipe away the image people had seared in their brains from
          the first debate." Even Kennedy acknowledged the medium's role in his
          victory. On November 12, 1960, four days after winning the election by
          a narrow margin, he said, "It was the TV more than anything else that
          turned the tide." Post-debate, candidates could no longer afford to
          ignore the potential power of television. "With the Nation Watching,"
          a 1979 task force report, notes, "The Nixon-Kennedy debates made
          televised encounters between candidates the hottest thing in
          electioneering since the campaign button."
        </p>
        <p>
          Up to that point, politics had not really been played out on
          television. "It was very much an entertainment medium," says
          Schroeder. "It wasn't a place for serious discourse." The next
          televised presidential debate wouldn't take place for 16 years,
          largely because candidates became wary of their influence. Lyndon B.
          Johnson was too intimidated by the medium to take on Barry Goldwater
          in 1964, and Nixon, having been burned before, refused to debate on TV
          in both 1968 and 1972. Televised debates reemerged 1976, when
          incumbent president Gerald Ford agreed to take on his Democratic
          challenger, Jimmy Carter. They've been standard practice in each
          campaign season since.

          After the debate, how you presented yourself, what you looked like,
          how you sounded and whether you connected directly with audiences
          mattered, says Larry Sabato, political analyst at the Center for
          Politics at the University of Virginia and author of the forthcoming
          book, The Kennedy Half-Century. "Before the television debates most
          Americans didn't even see the candidates — they read about them, they
          saw photos of them," he told TIME. "This allowed the public to judge
          candidates on a completely different basis." It's a reality that
          continues to influence campaigns today. "When parties are considering
          their candidates they ask: Who would look better on TV? Who comes
          across better? Who can debate better?" Sabato says. "This has been
          taken into the calculus."

          Beyond what the debate meant for the political arena, by catapulting
          Kennedy to the presidency, Sorensen speculates it fundamentally
          altered the world as we know it. In 1962, President Kennedy famously
          refused the recommendation by the Joint Chiefs of Staff to respond,
          militarily, to the Soviet Union's placing of nuclear missiles in Cuba.
          Sorensen said he is sure Nixon would have taken the Joint Chiefs
          advice ("he was more hawkish on military matters," he says). "Had
          [Nixon] done as the Joint Chiefs urged it would have started a nuclear
          war from which nobody would have survived," Sorensen said. "I think we
          should certainly be grateful that John F. Kennedy won that debate."
